        This app is designed to reference game details, players and allow stat tracking for players.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        To track stats for a player, click Stat Tracker in the menu. By default the current game will be selected. You just need to choose the player and Start Tracking!

        Feel free to navigate to the Players menu to view each players stored history.
